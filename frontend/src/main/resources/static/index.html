            <p><b>Bananas are berries</b> - Botanically, bananas are classified as berries, while strawberries are not!</p>
            <p><b>Octopuses have three hearts</b> - Two pump blood to the gills, and one pumps it to the rest of the body.</p>
            <p><b>The Eiffel Tower can grow taller</b> - The tower can grow up to 6 inches taller in summer due to the expansion of iron in the heat.</p>
            <p><b>Honey never spoils</b> - Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <p><b>Wombat poop is cube-shaped</b> - This unique shape helps it stay in place and mark territory without rolling away.</p>
            <p><b>There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on Earth</b> - With around 100 billion galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars, the universe holds more stars than there are grains of sand on all the Earth’s beaches.</p>
            <p><b>Sharks predate trees</b> - Sharks have been around for about 400 million years, while the first trees appeared around 350 million years ago.</p>
